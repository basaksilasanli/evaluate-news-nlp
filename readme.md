# Udacity Project

Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing
We will be building web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. Using an exciting new api called Aylien, we can build a simple web interface to interact with their NLP system. This tool will give us back pertinent information about the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.

Node and express will be the webserver and routing, and webpack will be our build tool of choice. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have development and production environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.

We will also use Jest to test our JavaScript functions of our application
